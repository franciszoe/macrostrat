    "The basic motivation for this model is to explicitly couple erosion with sedimentation on a broad (global) scale. All erosion generates sediment, but only some of this sediment has preservation potential. In this context, I take preservation to mean the deposition of sediments in environments where their preservation on billion year time scales is not precluded. These environments are for the most part continental interiors and marine sediments on continental shelves and along passive margins. Marine sediments that deposit along active margins, on the other hand, risk subduction (CHECK SUBDUCTION EFFICIENCY). \n",

    "Need to account for authigenic carbonate and evaporitic sediments, although ultimately carbonate formation does also depend on alkalinity supply which is erosional sustained, right? No erosion = no alkalinity. "
